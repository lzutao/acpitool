    - This is an ACPI client for Linux, written by David Leemans.
    Copyright (C) 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008  David Leemans. Please see 
    the INSTALL file for installation info.

    - See the homepage for this software: 
    http://freeunix.dyndns.org:8000/site/acpitool.shtml
    for more information and download link.

    - This ACPI client is intended to be a replacement for the apm tool.
    Even though APM works fine on a lot of laptops, it is deprecated
    and will be replaced by ACPI. Most newer laptops even require ACPI
    to boot properly. As such, it will be nice to have an ACPI client.
 
    - Obviously, you need a computer running a Linux kernel from the
    2.4.x or 2.6.x series with ACPI enabled, to use this program.
    A kernel from the 2.6 series is recommended, since that's where
    development of Linux ACPI code is going on.
    Intended audience of this applictaion are laptop users, since these are 
    the people most interested in stuff like battery status, thermal status and
    the ability to put their precious laptop to sleep. Most of this does not
    apply to desktop systems. 

    - WARNING : Linux ACPI support MIGHT work fine, as it does on my laptop, 
    might work, but with annoying problems or in a limited way, or might not work
    at all. See the "view existing bug reports" link on http://acpi.sourceforge.net/
    to get an idea of what can go wrong.     

    - Development of Acpitool started in June 2004, on a Toshiba Satellite Pro 6000, 
    then running Slackware 9.1. The Toshiba remained in use till September 2006, 
    when it was replaced with a Dell Latitude C640, currently running Slackware 11 
    with kernel 2.6.20. 
    The C640 was replaced in July 2008 with a Dell Latitude D610, curently running 
    Slackware 12.1 with kernel 2.6.26.

    - If you think you found a bug, have a feature request, would like to give some
    feedback, or just would like to contact me for whatever reason, DO NOT HESITATE
    to do so. 
    It is the only way I will ever know there is a bug, or that you want some 
    feature added. With your much appreciated help, Acpitool can only get better ;)
