Installation requirements
=========================
 
    1. A computer(laptop) running a fairly recent Linux distro, preferably with a kernel from the 2.6 series. 
  
    2. That kernel MUST have ACPI support enabled and /proc file support. Sysfs support
       is required for a kernel from the 2.6 series (not for 2.4).
       
       
       For ACPI, enable all options applicable to your system. You should enable at least the following:
       
       - sleep states
       - processor
       - button
       - thermal zone
       - battery
       - ac adapter
       - fan
       
    3. If you have a Toshiba laptop, you can enable kernel support the Toshiba ACPI extensions.
  
    4. If you have an Asus laptop, you can enable kernel support the ASUS ACPI extensions.
   
    5. a C++ compiler (gcc-g++ is fine, it worked for me anyway).
  
    6. If you have a pretty recent laptop, check out if supports frequency scaling, and enable 
       kernel support for it if it does.
     
    7. GNU Make 
  

Basic Installation
==================

    The simplest way to compile this package is:

    1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
       `sh configure'. When that's done, type `make' to compile the package.

    2. Type `make install' to install the program and any data files and documentation.

    3. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source code directory
       by typing `make clean'.  To remove the installed files that `make install' created,
       type `make uninstall'.
    
    4. You can set the CXXFLAGS environment variable to define compile options.  


Installation Names
==================

    By default, `make install' will install the package's files in `/usr/local/bin'. 
    You can edit the Makefile and specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local'.


How to use it
=============

    Acpitool is a CLI application, that means it has no fancy GUI with buttons or other crap.
    So, just type "acpitool", without the quotes, at your shell prompt and you should get some text output.
    If you want to find out which arguments it can handle, type "acpitool --help".
